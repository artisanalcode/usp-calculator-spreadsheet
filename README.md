# USP Calculator

### About

USP is a technique for estimating user story points. It is based on Use Case Point estimation.
The USP calculator (spreadsheet) "automates" the calculation of user story points, simply adjust a few values.
The calculator is based on the presentations by Fred Heath (@fredatbootstrap).

### How to use

Excel spreadsheet documents are zip files containing multiple `XML` files. 
To use this spreadsheet, package the contents of the `User Story Points Calculator` :file_folder: folder into a zip file, then rename its extension to `XLSX`.


:point_up: The calculator provides three results (use the one you prefer):
- Result based on a three-complexity-ranks calculation.
- Result based on "weighted" complexity factors.
- Experimental rounding to Fibonacci (as I am playing with the calculation to produce Fibonacci sequence numbers).
